### Development of EVMLiSA
Played an integral role in the development of [EVMLiSA](https://github.com/lisa-analyzer/evm-lisa), a specialized component of [LiSA](https://github.com/lisa-analyzer/lisa) (Library for Static Analysis), aimed at constructing complete Control‑Flow Graphs (CFGs) for Ethereum smart contracts. By leveraging these CFGs, orphan jumps are effectively resolved, enhancing the accuracy of the analysis. Through collaboration on the implementation of EVMLiSA, proficiency in software development and static analysis engineering was demonstrated, contributing to the advancement of tools for Ethereum blockchain analysis.

### In‑depth study of static analysis and abstract interpretation
Initiated the internship with an intensive two‑month period dedicated to an in‑depth study of static analysis and abstract interpretation. This comprehensive exploration laid the foundation for subsequent contributions to the development of EVMLiSA.

### Thoroughly study of design patterns for software development
Diligently delved into the study of design patterns and frameworks essential for professional software development, enriching skills and knowledge in creating robust and scalable software solutions.
