### Abstract

In this talk, we show how the LiSA framework can be instantiated to tackle a demonstrative IoT application where more than one programming language. The application was subject of a published paper where its static analysis was performed using a combination of separate tools, which tend to be inefficient. Instead, LiSA enables the analysis of the application as a whole, also considering cross-language interactions, to prove semantic properties of the whole system.
