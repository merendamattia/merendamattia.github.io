### Abstract

The aim of this talk is to introduce LiSA, a library for static analysis that focuses on multi-language analysis. LiSA is also modular, meaning that each component of the analysis has no knowledge on what lies outside of its scope: this enables effortless plugging of different in different analyses to obtain different levels of precision. We then briefly discuss applications of LiSA to widely different contexts, showcasing its flexibility in taclking different scenarios, together with a case study of a multi-language analysis.
