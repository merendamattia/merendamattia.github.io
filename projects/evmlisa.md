EVMLiSA is a specific implementation of a static analyzer using the LiSA (<b>Li</b>brary for <b>S</b>tatic <b>A</b>nalysis) library to conduct static analysis of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode. In particular, it is dedicated to generate a complete Control‑Flow Graph (CFG) of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. EVMLiSA’s primary objective is to provide semantic information and valuable warnings for developers and security auditors. 

EVMLiSA is distributed under the MIT license, and it is available on GitHub.
