`op-return-tracking-message-bitcoin` is a tool for tracking messages written in the `OP_RETURN` field of Bitcoin transactions. It explains how to decode these messages and provides a way to log and view them. Users can configure it by adding transaction hashes to a text file and view the results via a browser-based interface. 

The repository includes example code and resources for converting the hexadecimal `OP_RETURN` values to readable text.
