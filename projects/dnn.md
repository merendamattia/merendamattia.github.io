The DNN (Deep Neural Network) project is designed to create a neural network framework in C++ and it provides tools to define, train, and evaluate neural network models.
This project enables training neural networks using backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms. Users can specify network architectures, activation functions, and training parameters. Additionally, it offers features for loading and saving trained models.
