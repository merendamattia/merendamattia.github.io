I participated in the "Challenges of Software Verification" Symposium held on June 6-7, 2024, at Caâ€™ Foscari University of Venice. The event featured several sessions focusing on theoretical results, practical applications, innovative tools, and their impact on software engineering and DevOps. Selected abstracts were invited for full paper submission to a special issue of the Springer International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer. Previous symposium talks have been published in Springer-Nature journals.
