I attended the Lipari Summer School on Abstract Interpretation, held from September 1st to 7th, 2024, on Lipari Island, Italy. This week-long program was focused on abstract interpretation, static analysis, program analysis, software verification, and formal methods, including their applications in artificial intelligence and industry.
